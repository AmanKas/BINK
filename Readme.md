# Project Description
This project aims to enrich the C programming language by introducing Big Integers support,
enabling seamless manipulation of extremely large numbers beyond standard limits. The focus
lies on fundamental arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction, and
Multiplication. This enhancement empowers C programmers to tackle complex mathematical
challenges, such as Factorial and Fibonacci calculations, with precision and efficiency. By
bridging this gap, we aim to elevate C's capabilities and offer new avenues for innovation in
numerical computing.
